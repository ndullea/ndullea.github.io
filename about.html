			<p> <text> Hello my name is Nathan and welcome to my website. </text> </p>

			<p> <text> The intention behind this is to model a little project I have worked on. </text> </p>
			
			<p> <text> I made this from scratch with html, css, javascript and jquery. </text> </p>

			<p> <text> While working on this website I improved many skills including the ones mentioned above, and also began learning react.  </text> </p>

			<p> <text> It was a very fun experience making this website. I had a great time learning, and creating an actual product. There is still so much more to do and improve throughout the website; but I must move forward to work on other projects. I will certainly return to improving this in the future when I have more time. </text> </p>

			<p> <text> Here are some basic things I want to improve on this website. Change the setup using react components as the basis for the elements of the website. Improve the css such as colors and fonts, and furthermore, add animation and anything thing else I can do to improve the visual aesthetic. Finally, add a projects page where I can discuss other projects I am working and what I have learned from them.  </text> </p>

			<p> <text> This website is hosted by Github Pages. </text> </p>
