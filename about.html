		<div>
		<p> <text> Hello my name is Nathan and welcome to my website. </text> </p>

		<p> <text> The intention behind this is to model a little project I have worked on. </text> </p>
		
		<p> <text> I made this from scratch with html, css, jquery. </text> </p>

		<p> <text> While working on this website I improved many skills including the ones mentioned above, and also some react and javascript.  </text> </p>

		<p> <text> It was a very fun experience making this website. I had a great time learning, and making an actual product. There is still so much more to do and improve throughout the website; but I am becoming restless and going to work on other projects. I will certainly return to improving this in the future. </text> </p>

		<p> <text> Here are some basic things I want to improve on this website. Change the setup, using react component as the basis for the elements of the website. Improve the css such as colors and fonts, and furthermore, add animation and anything thing else I can do to improve the visual aesthetic. Finally, add a projects page where I can discuss other projects I am working and what I have learned from them.  </text> </p>

		<p> <text> This website is hosted by Github Pages. </text> </p>
