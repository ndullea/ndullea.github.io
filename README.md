# Making a website

I am making a website on with Github pages. 

## This Involves

Creating a new repository for the website.
Cloning the repository on the local device. 
Editing the html page, adding, commiting, and pushing it to github.

## My goals are
To make a website that has a nice feel, and a little bit of content.
